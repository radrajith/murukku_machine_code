murukku-maker-code
written for arduino uno.

purpose: I built a automatic Murukku(in tamil) or Chakli(in hindi) dough dispenser. Since it was a labor intense process to make them, i decided to attach a SM-4315 continuous rotation servo to do the spinning. The instrument used look like this (http://3.imimg.com/data3/XD/AQ/MY-9912623/ss-murukku-maker-500x500.jpg). There are three push buton to control the motions of the instrument.

since the insturment is round, some welding was required.
